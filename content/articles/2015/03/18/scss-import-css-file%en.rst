pyScss_ is a Scss_ compiler for Python. Sometimes we need to include (import)
regular CSS file in SCSS file. This post shows how to do it with pyScss_:

Assume that we have a css file called ``pygments.css``, we want to include this
file in our scss file:

1. Rename *pygments.css* to **_pygments.scss**
   (Prepend an underscore and switch the extension to ``scss``.)

2. Use `@import directive`_ to include the renamed CSS file in SCSS file:

   .. code-block:: scss

     @import "pygments";


Tested on: ``pyScss 1.3.4``

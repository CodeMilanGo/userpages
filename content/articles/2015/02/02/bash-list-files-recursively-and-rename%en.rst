Question:

  I have a lot of files under *content/articles* directory. The filenames are something like
  ``abc-def-ghi#en.rst``. I want to rename them all and replace the ``#`` with
  ``%``. For example, ``abc-def-ghi#en.rst`` will be renamed as
  ``abc-def-ghi%en.rst``, how do I do it?

Answer:

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/articles/2015/02/02/list-files-recursively-rename.sh

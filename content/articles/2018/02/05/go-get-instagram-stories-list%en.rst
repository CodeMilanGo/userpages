Interesting small program to get the JSON format data of the list of your
following Instagram_ stories.
The whole picture of getting the JSON comes from the post of Chrome IG Story
[1]_. Please read the post first.
In this program only Go standard library is used, no third-party packages.

To access the Instagram API via local Go program, you need to login Instagram_
and get the following information from your browser:

- ``ds_user_id``
- ``sessionid``
- ``csrftoken``

Please see this `SO answer`_ to get above values on Chrome browser.

After you get the values, modify the following code to fill the values:

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/ig-stories-list/config.go
.. adsu:: 2

After the values are set in the code, the following code can get JSON data of
the list of your following Instagram stories:

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/ig-stories-list/allstories.go
.. adsu:: 3

**Usage**:

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/ig-stories-list/allstories_test.go
.. adsu:: 4

Tested on: ``Ubuntu Linux 17.10``, ``Go 1.9.3``.

Interesting small program to get the JSON format data of stories of a specific
Instagram_ user.
The whole picture of getting the JSON comes from the post of Chrome IG Story
[1]_. Please read the post first.
In this program only Go standard library is used, no third-party packages.

To access the Instagram API via local Go program, you need to login Instagram_
and get the following information from your browser:

- ``ds_user_id``
- ``sessionid``
- ``csrftoken``

Please see this `SO answer`_ to get above values on Chrome browser.

Moreover, you need to know the user id of the specific user, please read my
previous post to get the id of the user. [3]_

After you get the values, you can get the JSON response from the following code:

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/ig-user-stories/userstories.go
.. adsu:: 2

How to parse the JSON data to get URL and timestamp of stories, please see my
GitHub repo [2]_.

Tested on: ``Ubuntu Linux 17.10``, ``Go 1.9.3``.

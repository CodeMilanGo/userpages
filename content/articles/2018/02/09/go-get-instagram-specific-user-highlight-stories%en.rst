**[Update]**: the method in this post can only get partial story highlights now.
Please see my `another new post`_ for how to get the rest of story highlights.

Interesting small program to get the JSON format data of highlight stories of a
specific Instagram_ user.

When I used Chrome extension `InstaG Downloader`_ version 2.1.0, I found it will
show highlight stories of users when you visit the page of the user. I am
curious how it works so I installed another extension `Network Sniffer`_ to see
the API URL of highlight stories, and found that API URL is

::

  https://i.instagram.com/api/v1/highlights/{{USERID}}/highlights_tray/

The procedure of reading JSON data is the same as the original story API [1]_.
Please read the post if you are not familiar with the API.

In this program only Go standard library is used, no third-party packages.

To access the Instagram API via local Go program, you need to login Instagram_
and get the following information from your browser:

- ``ds_user_id``
- ``sessionid``
- ``csrftoken``

Please see this `SO answer`_ to get above values on Chrome browser.

Moreover, you need to know the user id of the specific user, please read my
previous post to get the id of the user. [3]_

After you get the values, you can get the JSON response from the following code:

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/ig-highlight-story/config.go
.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/ig-highlight-story/userhighlightstories.go
.. adsu:: 2

**Example**:

.. show_github_file:: siongui userpages content/code/go/ig-highlight-story/userhighlightstories_test.go
.. adsu:: 3

How to parse the JSON data to get URL and timestamp of stories, please see my
GitHub repo [2]_.

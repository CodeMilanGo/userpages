:summary: Go_ implemantation of `succinct trie`_ ported from `Bits.js`_.
:adsu: yes


`Bits.js`_ ([1]_) implements a `succinct trie`_ for fast lookup of words in a
large dictionary and does not take much space at the same time. I have an
application which has about 200,000+ words to be encoded. It takes a lot of time
(over 30 minutes) to finish the job, so I decided to re-implement the succinct
trie in Golang_. The result [2]_ is great. It takes less than 2 minutes to
finish encoding the words. This post shows you how to use the Go_ implementation
of succinct trie.

The following code gives an example of encoding and decoding:

.. adsu:: 2
.. show_github_file:: siongui go-succinct-data-structure-trie example/usage.go
.. adsu:: 3

Note that you must include space " " in your alphabet if default alphabet is not
used. The default alphabet is *[a-z ]*.
